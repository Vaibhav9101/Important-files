What is an IAM OIDC provider?
IAM OIDC identity providers are entities in IAM that describe an external identity provider (IdP) service that supports the OpenID Connect (OIDC) standard, such as Google or Salesforce. You use an IAM OIDC identity provider when you want to establish trust between an OIDC-compatible IdP and your AWS account.

Workloads: HorizontalPodAutoscalers
The horizontal pod autoscaler automatically scales Pods depending on CPU demand.

Workloads: PriorityClasses
A PriorityClass is a non-namespaced object that defines a mapping from a priority class name to the integer value of the priority.

Workloads: CronJobs 
Cron Job manages a Job that runs on a periodic schedule.

Workloads: Jobs 
Job is a finite or batch task that runs to completion.

Workloads: DaemonSets
Daemonset ensures a copy of a Pod is running across a set of nodes in a cluster.

Workloads: StatefulSets
Statefulset manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods.

Workloads: Deployments
Deployment is an API object that manages a replicated application, typically by running Pods with no local state.

Workloads: ReplicaSets
ReplicaSet aims to maintain a set of replica Pods running at any given time.

Workloads: Pods
Pod is the smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. A Pod represents a set of running containers on your cluster.
